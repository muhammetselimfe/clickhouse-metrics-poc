# Metrics SQL Query Templates

This directory contains SQL templates for computing blockchain metrics at various time granularities. Most metrics are regular (per-period) only, while a few metrics also track cumulative (running total) values.

## Supported Granularities

- **hour** - 3600-second periods  
- **day** - 86400-second periods (UTC day boundaries)
- **week** - 604800-second periods (Sunday start)
- **month** - Variable duration (actual calendar months: 28-31 days)

## Template Placeholders

The metrics runner (`pkg/metrics/metrics_runner.go`) replaces these placeholders when executing queries:

| Placeholder | Description | Example Replacement |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `{chain_id:UInt32}` | Blockchain chain ID | `43114` |
| `{first_period:DateTime}` | Start of period range (inclusive) | `toDateTime64('2024-01-01 00:00:00.000', 3)` |
| `{last_period:DateTime}` | End of period range (exclusive) | `toDateTime64('2024-01-02 00:00:00.000', 3)` |
| `{granularity}` | Time granularity | `hour` |
| `toStartOf{granularity}` | ClickHouse function | `toStartOfHour` |
| `_{granularity}` | Table name suffix | `_hour` |

Note: `period_seconds` parameter is NOT used. For average metrics (TPS/GPS), period duration is calculated dynamically in SQL using `toUnixTimestamp(period + INTERVAL 1 {granularity}) - toUnixTimestamp(period)` to handle variable-length months correctly.

# File Structure

Each metric file contains:
1. Regular metric table definition and INSERT (all metrics)
2. Cumulative metric table definition and INSERT (only for: tx_count, addresses, contracts, deployers)

### Regular Metrics
Track values per period (e.g., transactions in an hour, gas used in a day). All metrics have regular versions.

### Cumulative Metrics
Track running totals over time (e.g., total transactions ever, total unique addresses ever). Only available for metrics where cumulative totals are meaningful: tx_count, addresses, contracts, and deployers. Built by:
1. Getting the last cumulative value before the current range
2. Reading from the regular metric table (with FINAL)
3. Calculating running sum with window functions

## Standard Table Structure

```sql
-- Regular metric table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS metric_name_{granularity} (
    chain_id UInt32,
    period DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),  -- Period start time
    value UInt64,                 -- Or UInt256 for large values
    computed_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(computed_at)
ORDER BY (chain_id, period);

-- Regular metric insert
INSERT INTO metric_name_{granularity} (chain_id, period, value)
SELECT
    {chain_id:UInt32} as chain_id,
    toStartOf{granularity}(block_time) as period,
    count(*) as value  -- or appropriate aggregation
FROM raw_transactions  -- or raw_traces, raw_logs, raw_blocks
WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
  AND block_time >= {first_period:DateTime}
  AND block_time < {last_period:DateTime}
GROUP BY period
ORDER BY period;

-- Cumulative metric table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cumulative_metric_name_{granularity} (
    chain_id UInt32,
    period DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),
    value UInt64,
    computed_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(computed_at)
ORDER BY (chain_id, period);

-- Cumulative metric insert (uses regular table)
INSERT INTO cumulative_metric_name_{granularity} (chain_id, period, value)
WITH 
-- Get the last cumulative value before our range
previous_cumulative AS (
    SELECT max(value) as prev_value
    FROM cumulative_metric_name_{granularity} FINAL
    WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
      AND period < {first_period:DateTime}
),
-- Get counts from regular table for our period range (use FINAL to get deduplicated values)
period_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        period,
        value as period_count
    FROM metric_name_{granularity} FINAL
    WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
      AND period >= {first_period:DateTime}
      AND period < {last_period:DateTime}
)
SELECT
    {chain_id:UInt32} as chain_id,
    period,
    -- Add previous cumulative value to our running sum
    ifNull((SELECT prev_value FROM previous_cumulative), 0) + 
    sum(period_count) OVER (ORDER BY period) as value
FROM period_counts
ORDER BY period;
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. DateTime64(3, 'UTC') for All Timestamps
- Millisecond precision with explicit UTC timezone
- Use `now64(3)` for computed_at defaults
- Consistent across all metric tables

### 2. Idempotent Processing
- COUNT ALL transactions in each period, not just new arrivals
- Same query always produces same result regardless of when run
- Enables safe reprocessing and backfilling

### 3. ReplacingMergeTree with computed_at
- Latest computation always wins
- Natural deduplication on (chain_id, period)
- Use FINAL keyword when reading for queries

### 4. Cumulative Metrics Build on Regular Metrics
- Regular metrics are source of truth
- Cumulative queries read from regular tables with FINAL
- Allows recomputation of cumulative without touching raw data
- Window functions (OVER ORDER BY) calculate running totals

### 5. Time Range Filtering
```sql
WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
  AND block_time >= {first_period:DateTime}  -- Inclusive
  AND block_time < {last_period:DateTime}    -- Exclusive [first, last)
```

## Metric Categories

### Transaction Count Metrics
- **tx_count** - Transaction count per period (regular + cumulative)
- **avg_tps** - Average transactions per second (regular only)
- **max_tps** - Maximum TPS within period (regular only)

### Gas Metrics  
- **gas_used** - Total gas consumed (regular only)
- **avg_gps** - Average gas per second (regular only)
- **max_gps** - Maximum GPS within period (regular only)
- **avg_gas_price** - Average gas price (regular only)
- **max_gas_price** - Maximum gas price (regular only)
- **fees_paid** - Total fees paid, UInt256 (regular only)

### Address Metrics
- **active_addresses** - Unique addresses active in period (from + to) (regular + cumulative)
- **active_senders** - Unique transaction senders (regular only)
- **deployers** - Unique contract deployers (regular + cumulative)
- **contracts** - Contracts deployed in period (regular + cumulative)

### ICM (Interchain Messaging) Metrics
- **icm_total** - Total ICM messages (sent + received) (regular only)
- **icm_sent** - ICM messages sent (regular only)
- **icm_received** - ICM messages received (regular only)

Note: ICM events are detected by specific topic0 hashes:
- Send: `unhex('2a211ad4a59ab9d003852404f9c57c690704ee755f3c79d2c2812ad32da99df8')`
- Receive: `unhex('292ee90bbaf70b5d4936025e09d56ba08f3e421156b6a568cf3c2840d9343e34')`

## Special Cases

### Unique Entity Cumulative Metrics
For metrics tracking unique entities that can appear multiple times (addresses, deployers), cumulative calculation differs:

1. Find entities that existed BEFORE the period range
2. Find NEW entities that first appear IN the period range
3. Count new entities per period
4. Add previous cumulative + running sum of new entities

This ensures cumulative counts grow correctly even with reprocessing.

See: `active_addresses.sql`, `deployers.sql`

Note: Contracts use simple cumulative (sum of period counts) since each contract can only be created once.

### Average Rate Metrics (TPS, GPS)
For time-based averages, calculate period duration dynamically:

```sql
WITH period_data AS (
    SELECT
        toStartOf{granularity}(block_time) as period,
        count(*) as tx_count
    FROM raw_transactions
    WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
      AND block_time >= {first_period:DateTime}
      AND block_time < {last_period:DateTime}
    GROUP BY period
)
SELECT
    {chain_id:UInt32} as chain_id,
    period,
    CAST(tx_count / (toUnixTimestamp(period + INTERVAL 1 {granularity}) - toUnixTimestamp(period)) AS UInt64) as value
FROM period_data
ORDER BY period;
```

This handles variable month lengths correctly (28-31 days) as well as all other granularities.

## Metrics Runner Behavior

The metrics runner (`pkg/metrics/metrics_runner.go`):

1. Tracks watermarks per (chain_id, metric_name, granularity)
2. Monitors latest block time via `OnBlock()` calls
3. Calculates complete periods using period boundary functions
4. Executes metric SQL for all complete periods in batch
5. Updates watermark after successful execution
6. Processes all granularities for each metric file

Watermarks are stored in:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS metric_watermarks (
    chain_id UInt32,
    metric_name String,        -- e.g., "tx_count_hour"
    last_period DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),
    updated_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(updated_at)
ORDER BY (chain_id, metric_name)
```

## Adding New Metrics

1. Create `metric_name.sql` in this directory
2. Follow the standard structure (regular + cumulative if applicable)
3. Use all required placeholders correctly
4. Test with multiple granularities
5. Verify idempotency (running twice produces same result)

### Example: Simple Count Metric

```sql
-- Widget count metrics (regular and cumulative)
-- Parameters: chain_id, first_period, last_period, granularity

-- Regular widget count table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS widgets_{granularity} (
    chain_id UInt32,
    period DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),
    value UInt64,
    computed_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(computed_at)
ORDER BY (chain_id, period);

INSERT INTO widgets_{granularity} (chain_id, period, value)
SELECT
    {chain_id:UInt32} as chain_id,
    toStartOf{granularity}(block_time) as period,
    count(*) as value
FROM raw_widgets
WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
  AND block_time >= {first_period:DateTime}
  AND block_time < {last_period:DateTime}
GROUP BY period
ORDER BY period;

-- Cumulative widget count table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cumulative_widgets_{granularity} (
    chain_id UInt32,
    period DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),
    value UInt64,
    computed_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(computed_at)
ORDER BY (chain_id, period);

INSERT INTO cumulative_widgets_{granularity} (chain_id, period, value)
WITH 
previous_cumulative AS (
    SELECT max(value) as prev_value
    FROM cumulative_widgets_{granularity} FINAL
    WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
      AND period < {first_period:DateTime}
),
period_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        period,
        value as period_count
    FROM widgets_{granularity} FINAL
    WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
      AND period >= {first_period:DateTime}
      AND period < {last_period:DateTime}
)
SELECT
    {chain_id:UInt32} as chain_id,
    period,
    ifNull((SELECT prev_value FROM previous_cumulative), 0) + 
    sum(period_count) OVER (ORDER BY period) as value
FROM period_counts
ORDER BY period;
```

## Querying Metrics

Always use FINAL when querying metric tables to get deduplicated results:

```sql
-- Get latest tx_count values
SELECT period, value
FROM tx_count_hour FINAL
WHERE chain_id = 43114
ORDER BY period DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Get cumulative growth
SELECT period, value
FROM cumulative_tx_count_hour FINAL
WHERE chain_id = 43114
  AND period >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY period;
```

## Important Notes

- All timestamps use DateTime64(3, 'UTC') with millisecond precision
- All metric files must work with all 4 granularities (hour/day/week/month)
- Only 4 metrics have cumulative versions: tx_count, addresses, contracts, deployers
- Cumulative metrics always read from regular metrics, never from raw tables
- Use FINAL keyword when reading from metric tables in queries or CTEs
- Period ranges are half-open intervals: [first_period, last_period)
- ReplacingMergeTree allows safe reprocessing and backfilling
- The system auto-creates tables: `metric_name_hour`, `metric_name_day`, etc.

-- QUERY EXAMPLES
-- ===========================================
-- Get current balance:
-- SELECT balance FROM erc20_balances FINAL
-- WHERE chain_id = ? AND wallet = ? AND token = ?

-- Get all token balances for a wallet:
-- SELECT token, balance
-- FROM erc20_balances FINAL  
-- WHERE chain_id = ? AND wallet = ? 
-- AND balance > 0

-- Get top holders of a token:
-- SELECT wallet, balance
-- FROM erc20_balances FINAL
-- WHERE chain_id = ? AND token = ?
-- ORDER BY balance DESC
-- LIMIT 100

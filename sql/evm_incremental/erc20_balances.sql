-- ERC-20 Balance Tracking - Two Table Approach
-- Table 1: Deltas (all transfers) - for history and recomputation
-- Table 2: Balance snapshots - for fast queries
-- Both queries are idempotent using ReplacingMergeTree

-- Step 1: Delta table stores every transfer event
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS erc20_deltas (
    wallet FixedString(20),
    token FixedString(20),
    block_number UInt32,
    transaction_index UInt16,
    log_index UInt32,
    delta Int256,  -- Positive for incoming, negative for outgoing
    computed_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(computed_at)
PARTITION BY intDiv(block_number, 1000000)
ORDER BY (wallet, token, block_number, transaction_index, log_index);

-- Step 2: Balance snapshots - stores balance after each block with activity
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS erc20_balances (
    wallet FixedString(20),
    token FixedString(20),
    block_number UInt32,
    balance UInt256,  -- Balance AFTER this block

-- QUERY EXAMPLES
-- ===========================================
-- Get balance at specific block:
-- SELECT balance FROM erc20_balances FINAL
-- WHERE wallet = ? AND token = ? AND block_number <= ?
-- ORDER BY block_number DESC LIMIT 1

-- Get all token balances for a wallet:
-- SELECT token, argMax(balance, block_number) as balance
-- FROM erc20_balances FINAL  
-- WHERE wallet = ? AND block_number <= ?
-- GROUP BY token
-- HAVING balance > 0

-- Get transfer history:
-- SELECT block_number, transaction_index, log_index, delta
-- FROM erc20_deltas FINAL
-- WHERE wallet = ? AND token = ?
-- ORDER BY block_number DESC, transaction_index DESC, log_index DESC

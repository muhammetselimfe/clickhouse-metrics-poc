# Incremental Indexers

This directory contains block-based incremental indexers that process blockchain data continuously as new blocks arrive. Unlike granular metrics (which are time-based), incremental indexers use block numbers for watermarking.

## Incremental Indexing System

- **Throttle**: All indexers run with minimum 0.9 seconds spacing between runs
- **Batch limit**: Processes up to 20,000 blocks per run
- **Use case**: Continuous, near real-time indexing of blockchain data
- **Examples**: Address tracking, contract deployments, token balances

## Template Placeholders

The indexer runner (`pkg/evmindexer/incremental.go`) replaces these placeholders:

| Placeholder | Description | Example Replacement |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `{chain_id:UInt32}` | Blockchain chain ID | `43114` |
| `{first_block:UInt64}` | First block number to process (inclusive) | `7563601` |
| `{last_block:UInt64}` | Last block number to process (inclusive) | `7564000` |

**Note**: Unlike granular metrics which use `block_time >= X AND block_time < Y`, incremental indexers use **inclusive ranges**: `block_number >= X AND block_number <= Y`

## Standard Structure

```sql
-- Create table (idempotent)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS indexer_name (
    -- your columns here
    computed_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(computed_at)
ORDER BY (your_primary_key);

-- Insert data (idempotent - ReplacingMergeTree handles duplicates)
INSERT INTO indexer_name (columns...)
SELECT DISTINCT
    -- your data
FROM raw_traces
WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
  AND block_number >= {first_block:UInt64}
  AND block_number <= {last_block:UInt64}
  -- additional filters
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Block Number Based
- Use `block_number` for filtering, not `block_time`
- Block numbers are sequential and never conflict (unlike block_time where multiple blocks can have same timestamp)
- Watermarks track `last_block_num` instead of `last_period`

### 2. Idempotent by Design
- ReplacingMergeTree handles duplicate inserts
- Safe to re-run on same block range
- On failure, watermark doesn't update, so blocks get reprocessed

### 3. Inclusive Range
- Both `first_block` and `last_block` are **inclusive**: `[first_block, last_block]`
- Different from granular metrics which use half-open intervals

### 4. No Granularity
- Single table per indexer (no hour/day/week/month variants)
- Tables grow continuously with new data

## Watermarks

Incremental indexers use block-based watermarks:

```sql
SELECT indexer_name, last_block_num 
FROM indexer_watermarks FINAL
WHERE chain_id = 43114
  AND indexer_name LIKE 'incremental/%'
```

Watermark pattern: `incremental/{indexer_name}`

## Example: Cross-Chain Address Tracking

See `address_on_chain.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS address_on_chain (
    address FixedString(20),
    chain_id UInt32,
    computed_at DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3)
) ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree(computed_at)
ORDER BY (address, chain_id);

INSERT INTO address_on_chain (address, chain_id)
SELECT DISTINCT
    address,
    {chain_id:UInt32} as chain_id
FROM (
    SELECT from as address
    FROM raw_traces
    WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
      AND block_number >= {first_block:UInt64}
      AND block_number <= {last_block:UInt64}
      AND from != unhex('0000000000000000000000000000000000000000')
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT to as address
    FROM raw_traces
    WHERE chain_id = {chain_id:UInt32}
      AND block_number >= {first_block:UInt64}
      AND block_number <= {last_block:UInt64}
      AND to IS NOT NULL
      AND to != unhex('0000000000000000000000000000000000000000')
)
WHERE address IS NOT NULL;
```

## Adding New Incremental Indexers

1. Create `indexer_name.sql` in `sql/evm_incremental/` directory
2. Use `{chain_id:UInt32}`, `{first_block:UInt64}`, `{last_block:UInt64}` placeholders
3. Filter by `block_number >= {first_block:UInt64} AND block_number <= {last_block:UInt64}`
4. Use ReplacingMergeTree for idempotency
5. Restart indexer runner - auto-discovers new files

All indexers run with 0.9 second minimum interval and process up to 20,000 blocks per batch.

## Querying Incremental Indexers

Always use `FINAL` to get deduplicated results:

```sql
-- Query address chains
SELECT DISTINCT chain_id 
FROM address_on_chain FINAL
WHERE address = unhex('742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb');

-- Check watermark progress
SELECT last_block_num 
FROM indexer_watermarks FINAL
WHERE chain_id = 43114 
  AND indexer_name = 'incremental/address_on_chain';
```

## Important Notes

- Incremental indexers start from block 1 on first run
- Use `block_number` for filtering, not `block_time`
- Ranges are **inclusive** on both ends: `[first_block, last_block]`
- ReplacingMergeTree handles duplicate inserts automatically
- Watermarks are block numbers, not timestamps
- New indexers are auto-discovered on startup
- Each chain processes independently with its own IndexRunner instance

-- Address to Chain mapping (incremental index)
-- Parameters: chain_id, first_block, last_block
--
-- Stores unique (address, chain_id) pairs for cross-chain address tracking.
-- Primary query: "SELECT DISTINCT chain_id FROM address_on_chain FINAL WHERE address = ?"
-- 
-- This is an incremental index, not a metric - no granularity.
-- Each run blindly inserts address-chain pairs; ReplacingMergeTree deduplicates on merge.
-- Optimized for fast incremental writes, acceptable read overhead with FINAL.

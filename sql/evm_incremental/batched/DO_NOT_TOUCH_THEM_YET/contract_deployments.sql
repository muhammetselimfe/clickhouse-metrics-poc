-- This indexer finds contract creation transactions and stores
-- a mapping from contract address to its deployment transaction hash and block number.
-- This allows for efficient lookup of how a contract was deployed.

-- The table stores the deployment information for each contract.
-- It uses ReplacingMergeTree to handle potential re-processing of blocks,
-- ensuring that each contract address has only one entry.
